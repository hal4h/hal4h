# 👋 Hi there! I'm Halah Mhanni

🎓 I'm a 4th year Computer Science student with a passion for building thoughtful, performant software — from low-level systems to real-world fintech products.

🚀 Currently:
- 🧪 **Software Developer Co-op @ Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada**  
   Working on tools that support Canadian agriculture using modern web technologies and backend systems.
- 🧠 **Founder & Developer of [Sentivest](https://github.com/your-sentivest-repo)**  
   A sentiment-based stock analysis tool for retail investors.

💻 Interests:
- 🖥️ **Low-level programming** — exploring operating systems, memory management, and performance optimization.
- 🧩 **Computer architecture** — fascinated by how hardware and software interact at the instruction level.
- 💰 **Fintech** — building tools that empower users to understand markets and take control of their financial future.
- 🛠️ **Software development** — from scripting and automation to full-stack applications.

🌱 I'm constantly learning — whether it’s improving my systems knowledge, shipping full-stack projects, or digging deeper into the internals of compilers, processors, or distributed systems.
